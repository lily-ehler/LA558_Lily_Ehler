<h3>Leaflet Map with Markers</h3>
This map shows the various locations I visited to sketch while studying 
abroad in Rome. Beginning <br>with a CSV file of the data points, I created a 
map with a specified base map (Esri World Gray Canvas) <br>and pop ups showing 
the site name and the type of building. I then created a custom pencil icon 
from a <br>PNG for the data points using a feature within the Leaflet library.

<h3>Leaflet Choropleth Map</h3>
This choropleth map depicts the average real estate value per square meter
in Euros for each "zone <br>urbanistiche" or "urban zone" within the city of Rome. After loading
the shapefile into R, I set the bins <br>(breaks), color palette, labels, and bounds before coding
the Leaflet map. I used the Esri World Gray <br>Canvas as the base map, added highlight 
interactions showing the zone urbanistiche name and average <br>real estate value, and added a 
legend.

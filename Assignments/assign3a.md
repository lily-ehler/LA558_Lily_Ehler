### Geospatial PDF

This map was created in QGIS and exported as a geospatial PDF. It shows a choropleth map of 2021 population data for each of Malta's local administrative units (LAUs). The shapefile was joined to a dataset from Eurostat, with the fields refactored to display the data as a choropleth.

### GIS2Web

The following map was created in QGIS and exported to the web using the GIS2Web plugin. The map shows the locations of foreign embassies in Malta. The pop-up for each marker displays the embassy name, the country represented in the embassy, the Maltese city where the embassy is located, and the embassy's full address.
